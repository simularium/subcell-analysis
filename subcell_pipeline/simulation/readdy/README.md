# ReaDDy simulations

Simulations and processing for particle-based reaction-diffusion simulator [ReaDDy](https://readdy.github.io/).

## Run ReaDDy simulations (compression and no compression)

> - **Base simulator**: [https://github.com/readdy/readdy](https://github.com/readdy/readdy)
> - **Model development**: [https://github.com/simularium/readdy-models](https://github.com/simularium/readdy-models)

- **Run ReaDDy compression simulations** ([source](https://github.com/simularium/readdy-models/tree/main/examples/actin) | [readme](https://github.com/simularium/readdy-models/blob/main/examples/README.md))


## Process baseline single actin fiber with no compression

The `ACTIN_NO_COMPRESSION` simulation series simulates a single actin fiber with a free barbed end across five replicates.

## Process single actin fiber compressed at different compression velocities

The `ACTIN_COMPRESSION_VELOCITY` simulation series simulates compression of a single 500 nm actin fiber at four different velocities (4.7, 15, 47, and 150 Î¼m/s) with five replicates.
